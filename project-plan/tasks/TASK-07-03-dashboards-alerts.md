# TASK-07-03 Dashboards and Alerts Configuration

- Story: STORY-07 Azure DevOps Observability with Dynatrace
- Estimate: 4 days
- Dependencies: TASK-07-02 Pipeline Integration
- Steps:
  1. Design custom Dynatrace dashboards for IAM pipeline monitoring (build duration, success rates, stage timings).
  2. Create dashboards showing historical trends and performance baselines.
  3. Configure alerting rules for critical pipeline failures, performance degradation, and SLA violations.
  4. Set up notification channels (email, Teams, ServiceNow) for alert distribution.
  5. Implement anomaly detection for pipeline metrics to identify unusual patterns.
  6. Test alert firing and notification delivery for various failure scenarios.
- Deliverables:
  - Production-ready Dynatrace dashboards for IAM pipeline monitoring.
  - Alert rules configured with appropriate thresholds and notification routing.
  - Validated alert system with documented escalation procedures.
