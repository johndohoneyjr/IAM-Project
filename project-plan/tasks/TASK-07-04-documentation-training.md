# TASK-07-04 Documentation and Training

- Story: STORY-07 Azure DevOps Observability with Dynatrace
- Estimate: 2 days
- Dependencies: TASK-07-03 Dashboards and Alerts Configuration
- Steps:
  1. Create comprehensive documentation for Dynatrace monitoring setup and configuration.
  2. Document the KPI catalog (definitions/formulas/targets) and how to interpret each KPI in dashboards (including success rate goal 95% / minimum 90%).
  3. Document external dependency monitoring (e.g., ServiceNow) including known interfaces (API/webhook/connector/manual gates), failure modes, and the alert thresholds used.
  4. Develop troubleshooting runbook for common pipeline issues using Dynatrace data (flaky tests, slow stages, queue time spikes, dependency outages).
  4. Prepare training materials (slides, demo scenarios) for team onboarding.
  5. Conduct hands-on training session with pipeline engineers and operations team.
  6. Gather feedback and update documentation based on team input.
- Deliverables:
  - Monitoring setup documentation stored with pipeline governance assets.
  - KPI catalog reference and interpretation guide.
  - Troubleshooting runbook with Dynatrace-based diagnostic workflows.
  - External dependency monitoring + alert threshold documentation.
  - Completed training session with recorded demo and Q&A.
  - Team equipped to use Dynatrace for pipeline optimization and incident response.
